Inventory and Broadcast Commands Demo
====================================

This test file demonstrates the key features of the Zappy server:
1. Inventory management (Take, Set, Inventory commands)
2. Broadcast communication system
3. Vision system (Look command)

These tests showcase the core gameplay mechanics for tomorrow's review.
